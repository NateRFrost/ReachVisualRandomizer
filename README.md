# Requirements
- Halo Reach on MCC
- Halo Reach offiical mod tools (aka HREK)
  - They can be downloaded via steam https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695793/Halo_Reach_Mod_Tools__MCC/
 
# How to use
1. Consider backing up your game files for MCC as the tool will overwrite them.
2. If you use the mod tools for other purposes, consider backing up any files you've edited as the tool will overwrite them
3. Start ReachVisualRandomizer.exe
4. Configure your seed and other settings as you please (default settings recommended)
5. Make sure the MCC path and HREK path matches what is on your computer.
     - You check the path of each from your steam library by: right clicking -> manage -> browser local files
     - If you have your MCC installation across multiple locations, make sure it is the one where the Reach campaign is installed.
6. Click start randomization. The first level takes 10+ minutes to finish randomizing. All levels finished randomizing in about 60 minutes.
7. Play! You can play levels that have already been randomized while you wait for the rest to randomize.

# FAQ
- What does this randomize?
  - Enemy types, the weapons they hold, if they are in vehicles (no vehicle to vehicle only), they types of vehicles they use, weapons, vehicles, equipment and misc objects that can be found in the world, custscene dialogue, and cutscene model variants. Certain enemies that if randomized could softlock the game and allies are not randomized.
- How likely is a softlock?
  - Unlikely with default settings. If you get stuck, try looking around for enemies (jetpack elites can get in weird spots) or backtracking and going back through a level without using a jetpack or flying vehicle. If you don't use the default settings, sometimes the required-to-progress target locater can clip out of bounds near the beginning of ONI: Sword Base.
- Why does the randomizer take so long?
  - It builds and compiles each level from scratch using the offiical mod tools. This ensures that all objects are loaded into each level and made it drasticlly easier for me to code.
- Will you make randomizers for the other Halo games?
  - I might make randmoziers for 3, ODST, or 4 as those are compatible with this method of randomization.

 Huge thanks to Daniel McCluskey for laying the groundwork for this tool.
